# .ruma — A Semantic, AI-Native Document Format

> *What if documents didn’t store how things look, but what they mean?*

## What is `.ruma`?

`.ruma` is a conceptual document format designed to store **semantics**, **instructions**, and **generation prompts** — instead of visual layout or markup. It proposes a lightweight, prompt-driven file that’s interpreted by AI-based plugins to render consistent visuals across platforms.

- **Meaning over markup**  
- **Dynamic rendering instead of static layout**  
- **Lightweight and efficient for storage, sharing, and searching**  

It’s a rethinking of how documents are created, stored, and used.

## Why this idea?

Sometimes when I’m free, I escape the present and dive into idea space.

One question stuck:  
**“What if we stopped storing visual results, and stored only the instructions to generate them?”**

That’s the heart of `.ruma`.  
A document that can be opened, edited, and shared as pure intent — and rendered consistently by AI on any system.

## How it could work

1. A `.ruma` file holds:
   - Semantic structure  
   - Content-specific prompts  
   - Interaction logic (abstracted)  

2. A browser or system plugin interprets the file using its internal model.  
3. The visual UI is generated consistently at runtime — no layout code needed.  
4. The document remains editable via prompt, not code.

## Status

This is not a working format — just a concept.  
But it sketches a possible future where documents are:

- Platform-independent  
- Easy to store and search  
- AI-readable and prompt-editable  

A new way to think about files — from fixed content to dynamic meaning.
